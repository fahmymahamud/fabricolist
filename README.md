# 🎓 What I Learnt

This final capstone project at the Generation Singapore Junior Data Engineering Bootcamp was a deep dive into real-world pipeline orchestration.
Working as part of Group 5 – Cart Catalysts, I helped design and implement a modular data pipeline using Microsoft Fabric and Medallion architecture to clean, transform, and visualize Olist’s e-commerce data.

Through this project, I learnt how to:

🏗️ **Build scalable**, audit-ready pipelines using Fabric Notebooks, PySpark, and Delta Lake

🧼 **Apply robust data cleaning** logic with schema validation, null handling, and enrichment

🔄 **Orchestrate** multi-layered workflows across Bronze, Silver, and Gold Lakehouse stages

📊 Deliver stakeholder-ready dashboards using **Power BI**, semantic modeling, and drill-through analytics

🧠 Implement **Market Basket Analysis** with the Apriori algorithm for product recommendation insights

🔍 Integrate monitoring, alerting, and validation to ensure pipeline integrity and traceability

This project sharpened my skills in pipeline design, collaborative debugging, and stakeholder storytelling — and gave me the confidence to tackle complex data engineering challenges with clarity and precision.
